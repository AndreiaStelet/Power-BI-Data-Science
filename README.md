# Power-BI-Data-Science
This repository's purpose is to post my progress in learning Power BI, the difficulties I find with the tool. 
I already have a background in Data Science and extensive experience in BI with Cognos tools. 
From 2009 to 2018 I have worked with Cognos tools (Cognos Report Studio, Framework Manager, TM1, Query Studio)
Until 2018, Cognos only referred to the Descriptive and Diagnostic analysis, based on history. 
Power BI also allows the analyst to work from a Predictive as well as a Prescriptive perspective, 
regarding business decisions purposes. .
